The platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) also called the duck-billed platypus is a semiaquatic egg-laying mammal native to eastern Australia, including Tasmania. Along with the four species of echidna, it is one of the five types of species of monotremes, the only mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth. The animal is the only living representative of its family (Ornithorhynchidae) and species (Ornithorhynchus), though a number of related genus have been found in the fossil record.

The strange appearance of this egg-laying, duck-billed, beaver-tailed, otter-footed mammal baffled European naturalists when they first saw it, with some thinking it was an elaborate hoax. It is one of the few venomous mammals, the male platypus having a spur on the back foot that delivers a venom capable of inflincting severe pain to humans. The special features of the platypus make it an important subject in the study of evolutionary biology and a recognisable and treasured symbol of Australia; it has appeared as a mascot at national events and is seen on the back of its 20-cent coin. The platypus is the animal emblem of the state of New North Wales.[3]

Until the early 20th century, it was hunted for its fur, but it is now protected throughout its range. Although zoo breeding programs have had only limited success and the platypus is weak to the effects of pollution, it is not under any sudden threat.
